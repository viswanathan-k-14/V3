# Installation Instructions

We use the templating language [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to create themes.

1. Enable Custom HTML templates in HelpDocs. Head to **Settings** > **Brand**, and choose **Custom** as your **Template**
2. The files in this folder match up with the headers in **Settings** > **Templates**. You should copy each to their respective tab and hit **Save**
2. Copy the content from `scripts.js` in this folder into **Settings** > **Code** > **Scripts** and hit **Save**
3. You can load our default CSS from the HelpDocs CDN by adding this line to the top of **Settings** > **Code** > **Scripts**:

You can load our default CSS from the HelpDocs CDN by adding this line to the top of Settings > Code > Scripts:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.helpdocs.io/css/v3/bars.min.css?cb=custom">
```

If you want to customize the CSS instead, don't bother with the `<link ...>` above. Head to [the CSS file](https://cdn.helpdocs.io/css/v3/bars.min.css?cb=custom) in your browser and copy the contents into **Settings** > **Code** > **CSS**.

Now you can edit any of the files to your heart's content. ðŸŽ‰
